**Project Title:** Setu: The Voice-to-ONDC Gateway for Indian Farmers

**Selected Theme:** Open Innovation Track (Smart Agriculture / Social Impact)

**Abstract:**

**The Problem:**
India's digital commerce revolution (ONDC) is bypassing its most vital sector: agriculture. Despite 260 million farmers, the vast majority remain "invisible" to the digital economy. The barriers are structural: linguistic diversity (interfaces are primarily in English), low digital literacy (inability to navigate complex forms), and technical complexity (managing catalogs and inventory). Consequently, farmers are forced to sell to local middlemen at a fraction of fair market value, unable to access the broader national market.

**The Solution:**
**Setu** bridges this divide by replacing complex graphical interfaces with the most natural human interface: **Voice**. It is a production-grade gateway that enables illiterate farmers to list produce on the ONDC network simply by speaking in their native language.

**How It Works:**
1.  **Voice Input:** The farmer taps a single button and speaks naturally (e.g., "I have 500kg of Nashik Onions to sell at 25 rupees").
2.  **AI Processing:** Powered by **Google Gemini 3 Flash**, the system transcribes the speech, translates it from regional languages (Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, etc.) to English, and intelligently extracts structured data (Commodity, Quantity, Price, Quality).
3.  **Protocol Conversion:** The system maps this data to the **Beckn Protocol (v1.2.0)**, generating valid JSON schemas required for the ONDC network.
4.  **Network Broadcast:** The catalog is instantly broadcast to the open network, making it visible to thousands of potential buyers (retailers, wholesalers) simultaneously.

**Key Innovations:**
*   **Multilingual AI Core:** Leveraging Gemini's advanced context window to handle dialect nuances and mixed-language speech (Hinglish/Tanglish).
*   **Zero-UI Design:** Removing the need for typing or reading, making digital commerce accessible to the completely illiterate.
*   **Real-Time Mandi Integration:** Fetches live government price data (Agmarknet) to suggest fair pricing to farmers before they list.

**Impact:**
Setu democratizes access to the digital economy. It transforms the mobile phone from a consumption device into a powerful economic tool, ensuring that the benefits of ONDC reach the "last mile"—the Indian farmer.
